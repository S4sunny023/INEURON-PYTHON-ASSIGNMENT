    "The try statement is used in programming to handle exceptions, which are unexpected or erroneous conditions that occur during the execution of a program. The purpose of the try statement is to define a block of code where an exception might occur, and then provide a mechanism for handling the exception if it does occur.\n",

If an exception occurs during the execution of the code, the try block immediately stops executing and the program jumps to the first except block that matches the type of the exception that occurred.
