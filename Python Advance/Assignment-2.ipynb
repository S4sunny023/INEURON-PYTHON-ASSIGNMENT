    "The operator should have a clear and intuitive meaning in the context of your class. For example, it makes sense to overload the + operator for a Vector class to perform vector addition, but it may not make sense to overload the + operator for a Person class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overloaded operator should follow the principle of least surprise. The behavior of the operator should be consistent with the behavior of the same operator when used with built-in types. For example, the == operator should test for equality, and the < operator should test for less than.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overloaded operator should not violate the fundamental properties of the operator. For example, the + operator should be commutative and associative, which means that (a + b) + c should be the same as a + (b + c) and a + b should be the same as b + a.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overloaded operator should not be used in a way that conflicts with its original meaning. For example, if you overload the * operator to perform scalar multiplication for a Vector class, you should not use it to perform string repetition in the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overloaded operator should be well-documented and well-tested, so that other developers can understand its behavior and use it correctly.\n",
