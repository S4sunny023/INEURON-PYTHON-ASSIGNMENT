    "\n",
    "They are less expressive: Raising an exception with a string message provides less information about the nature of the exception. By contrast, defining a custom exception class with specific properties and methods provides more information about the exception type and its properties, which can be useful for debugging and handling the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are harder to catch: Because string-based exceptions are simply strings, they can be raised by any part of the code, which makes it harder to catch specific exceptions. By contrast, using custom exception classes allows you to catch specific types of exceptions, which can help you handle errors more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are less maintainable: When using string-based exceptions, it can be difficult to maintain consistency in the error messages used throughout your codebase. By contrast, defining custom exception classes with consistent error messages makes your code more maintainable and easier to understand."
