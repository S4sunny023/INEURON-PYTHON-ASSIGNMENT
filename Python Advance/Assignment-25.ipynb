    "A NumPy array is a multidimensional array of homogeneous data types (i.e., all elements have the same data type). NumPy arrays have a fixed size and shape, and can only hold numerical data, such as integers and floating-point numbers. NumPy arrays are efficient for mathematical operations and calculations.\n",

    "On the other hand, a Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional table with labeled axes (i.e., rows and columns) that can hold data of different data types, including numerical data, text, and categorical data. Pandas DataFrames are versatile and can handle various data formats, such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases. They also have built-in functions for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis."
