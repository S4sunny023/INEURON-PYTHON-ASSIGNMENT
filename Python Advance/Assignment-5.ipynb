    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent class. In this way, a class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes, allowing it to combine their functionality into a single derived class. This can be useful in situations where a class needs to have characteristics from multiple sources or when creating complex class hierarchies. "
