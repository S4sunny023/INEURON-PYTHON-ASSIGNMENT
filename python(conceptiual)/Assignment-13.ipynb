    "Excel spreadsheets offer several advantages over CSV (Comma-Separated Values) spreadsheets, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting: Excel allows you to format cells, rows, and columns in a variety of ways, including font styles and sizes, cell colors, borders, and alignment. CSV files do not support formatting, so if you want to add any style or structure to your data, you will need to use another tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas and Functions: Excel has a wide range of built-in formulas and functions that you can use to perform complex calculations and analysis on your data. CSV files only contain raw data and do not have any built-in formulas or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charts and Graphs: Excel makes it easy to create professional-looking charts and graphs from your data. You can choose from a variety of chart types, customize colors and styles, and even add labels and annotations. CSV files do not support charts or graphs, so you would need to use a separate tool to visualize your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting and Filtering: Excel allows you to sort and filter your data based on specific criteria, making it easier to analyze and manipulate large datasets. CSV files can be sorted in a basic way using a text editor or spreadsheet program, but do not offer the advanced sorting and filtering options that Excel does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration: Excel allows multiple users to work on the same file simultaneously, with changes being updated in real-time. CSV files do not support real-time collaboration and can only be edited by one user at a time."
