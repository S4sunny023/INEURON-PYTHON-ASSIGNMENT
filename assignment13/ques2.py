Question 2:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The
element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]'''


X = int(input("Enter X: "))
Y = int(input("Enter Y: "))

# Create a 2-dimensional array of size X by Y
array = [[0 for j in range(Y)] for i in range(X)]

# Populate the array
for i in range(X):
    for j in range(Y):
        array[i][j] = i*j

# Print the array
for row in array:
    print(row)
