Question 1:
Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and
7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
100
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,35,70

Question 2:
Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma
separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
10
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,2,4,6,8,10

Question 3:
The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n&gt;1
Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma
separated form with a given n input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
7

Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13

Question 4:
Assuming that we have some email addresses in the &quot;username@companyname.com&quot; format,
please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and
company names are composed of letters only.
Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:
john@google.com
Then, the output of the program should be:
john

Question 5:
Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function
which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area
of the shape where Shape&#39;s area is 0 by default.
